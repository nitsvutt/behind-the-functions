Along with the useful of the Rapid Application Development, a human readable and functional programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Dart, always play a vital role. But gravitating towards using them without a deep understand on how these work as a new borns is somewhat dead end, especially when you want to write your application in a more object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java and Scala. So let's dive deep into the algorithm, the main character behind every functions.
