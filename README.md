## Abstract

Along with the useful of the Rapid Application Development, human readable and functional programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and Dart, always play a vital role. These days, gravitating towards using them without a deep understand on their essence is somewhat practical, but what happens when you intend to write your application in more object-oriented programming languages like C++, Java and Scala, you will feel overwhelmed. As a result, not only beginners but also experts should "dive into the algorithm", the main character behind every functions, as a new born.
